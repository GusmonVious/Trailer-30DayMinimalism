        <h2>7-Day Minimalism Challenge</h2>
        <div class="plan-content">
          <h3>Day 1: Awareness as Weapon</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>You can't cut what you don't see.</p>
          <p><strong>Morning</strong><br>
          Start your Minimalist Journal.<br>
          Ask yourself: "What do I use, love, or need daily, and why?"<br>
          -10-Minute Environment Scan. Walk through your room and take photos. Don't clean. Just observe.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Evening</strong><br>
          -Digital Inventory.<br>
          Screenshot your home screen, browser tabs, open apps.<br>
          Write: What do I open out of habit vs. purpose?</p>
          
          <p>Identify your top 3 "content addiction" apps/sites.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Discomfort Drill:</strong><br>
          Turn your phone grayscale for the next 48 hours. (It'll reduce dopamine hits.)</p>

          <h3>Day 2: Clear Physical Clutter (1/2 Physical)</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>You own more than you can handle.</p>
          <p><strong>Morning</strong><br>
          Focus on just one category: Clothes.<br>
          Sort into 3 piles: Essential, Occasional, Dead Weight.<br>
          Use the 3-second rule: If you hesitate, it goes in Dead Weight.</p>

          <p><strong>Afternoon</strong><br>
          Box the "maybe" pile. Label it with today's date. Store it out of sight for 30 days.<br>
          Remove 3 decorative items that add no function or joy.</p>

          <p><strong>Evening Journal Prompt:</strong><br>
          "What did I learn about myself through what I kept or gave away?"</p>

          <h3>Day 3: Cut the Digital Fat (1/2 Digital)</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>Your attention is your currency.</p>
          <p><strong>Morning</strong><br>
          Turn off all non-essential notifications. (Except calendar, messages.)<br>
          Delete 2 apps you haven't used in 30 days.</p>

          <p><strong>Afternoon</strong><br>
          Go through one platform (e.g., YouTube, TikTok, Instagram) and unfollow 10+ creators who don't serve your growth.<br>
          Ask: Is this person inspiring, educating, or numbing me?</p>

          <p><strong>Evening Discomfort Drill:</strong><br>
          1-hour Digital Fast: No screen, no music, no background noise. Just you, paper, pen.</p>

          <p><strong>Journal:</strong> "Re-organize your life and what's been happening around you, write what you feel like would give you mental clarity"</p>

          <h3>Day 4: Mind and Space</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>What you keep around you shapes your inner world.</p>
          <p><strong>Morning</strong><br>
          Declutter your desk/study area.<br>
          Remove 5+ items that aren't used weekly.<br>
          Lightly clean—visual clarity breeds mental clarity.</p>

          <p><strong>Afternoon</strong><br>
          Organize digital files: School folders, downloads, desktop.<br>
          Archive or delete anything you won't use this term.</p>

          <p><strong>Evening</strong><br>
          Replace 30 minutes of phone scrolling with 30 minutes of reading.<br>
          Optional: Try Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport or if you want something more unfiltered, try Amusing Ourselves to Death by Neil Postman.</p>

          <p><strong>Journal Prompt:</strong> "What do I need digitally?"</p>

          <h3>Day 5: Emotional Clutter</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>Minimalism is mental surgery.</p>
          <p><strong>Morning</strong><br>
          Write a "Let Go List": Relationships, habits, beliefs, or memories that no longer serve you.<br>
          Even if you don't act on them, acknowledging is powerful.</p>

          <p><strong>Afternoon</strong><br>
          25-minute walk or journaling with no music, just reflection.</p>

          <p><strong>Evening</strong><br>
          Choose one "uncomfortable" task you've been avoiding (schoolwork, conversation, etc.)—do it.</p>

          <p><strong>Journal:</strong> "What am I afraid to let go of—and why?". Be rough with yourself, it's not a time for excuses, it's a time for honest reflection, the 5 days you've followed along has given you mental clarity, don't waste this chance.</p>

          <h3>Day 6: Build What Matters</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>Theme: Minimalism is not just subtraction, it's elevation.</p>
          <p><strong>Morning Routine Overhaul</strong><br>
          Add 3 things that serve your mental, emotional, or physical growth.</p>

          <p>Suggestions: reading 5 pages, 2-minute breathwork, journaling, stretching.</p>

          <p><strong>Afternoon</strong><br>
          Build a Minimalist Tool Kit:<br>
          3 apps, books, or people who contribute to growth. That's it.</p>

          <p>Bookmark them. Remove everything else from your homepage/dock for now.</p>

          <p><strong>Evening Discomfort Drill:</strong><br>
          Set a 2-hour block tomorrow for "Deep Focus"—no phone, music, or distractions.<br>
          Decide in advance what task you'll tackle.</p>

          <h3>Day 7: The Renewal</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>Minimalism is a lifestyle, not an event.</p>
          <p><strong>Morning</strong><br>
          Self-Check Audit: Revisit the photos, journals, and lists from Day 1.<br>
          What changed physically, mentally, digitally?</p>

          <p><strong>Afternoon</strong><br>
          Don't make a list of what to keep, only decide if to leave or keep, if you hesitate, it's a leave.<br>
          Be brutal. You've earned the clarity.</p>

          <p>Write a letter to yourself titled: "The Person I want to be in 30 days."<br>
          Make up a personality, an alter ego, follow what it would do until you eventually become the alter ego itself.</p>

          <p><strong>Evening</strong><br>
          Clean your space while playing calm music, impulsive music kills focus.<br>
          Light a candle, open your window, or do something novel.</p>

          <p>Commit to Weekly Reset Sundays (30 min to declutter, journal, plan).<br>
          Document what has happened and what you should do, don't hesitate.</p>
